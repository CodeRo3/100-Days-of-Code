# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 21, 2021 Monday

**Today's Progress**: I reimagined my future and put together a general plan since I was rejected from Ada Developers Academy C16. First, I started the Foundations course in The Odin Project! I completed 15% of the course. I learned so much about how the web works and the important distinction between the web and the internet. I didn't do any real coding, but I feel that what I learned today is extremely important to my growth as a software developer which is why I considered today Day 0. 

**Thoughts:** As long as I keep at it, I WILL make it as a software developer! I will fail a lot more along the way, and that is completely okay! I chose The Odin Project over CS50 because I feel that The Odin Project provides me the resources with the goal of shaping me into a fullstack developer in mind. CS50 is more akin to a college course, so I'd like to tackle it after I've gained the necessary skills that will help me break into the software development field as soon as possible.

**Link to work:** None.


### Day 1: June 22, 2021 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I continued onwards with the Foundations course in The Odin Project! I learned so much about the command line and enjoyed practicing what I learned on my own Macbook's terminal!

**Thoughts**: This stuff is hard, but I am still riding the highs of motivation and determination! Now to set up a consistent study and sleep schedule so that I'm not so tired after work. I literally fell asleep at my desk while studying today haha!

**Link(s) to work**: None.
