# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 21, 2021 Monday

**Today's Progress:** I reimagined my future and put together a general plan since I was rejected from Ada Developers Academy C16. First, I started the Foundations course in The Odin Project! I completed 15% of the course. I learned so much about how the web works and the important distinction between the web and the internet. I didn't do any real coding, but I feel that what I learned today is extremely important to my growth as a software developer which is why I considered today Day 0. 

**Thoughts:** As long as I keep at it, I WILL make it as a software developer! I will fail a lot more along the way, and that is completely okay! I chose The Odin Project over CS50 because I feel that The Odin Project provides me the resources with the goal of shaping me into a fullstack developer in mind. CS50 is more akin to a college course, so I'd like to tackle it after I've gained the necessary skills that will help me break into the software development field as soon as possible.

### Day 1: June 22, 2021 Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** I continued onwards with the Foundations course in The Odin Project! 27% completion. I learned so much about the command line and enjoyed practicing what I learned on my own Macbook's terminal!

**Thoughts:** This stuff is hard, but I am still riding the highs of motivation and determination! Now to set up a consistent study and sleep schedule so that I'm not so tired after work. I literally fell asleep at my desk while studying today haha!

### Day 2: June 23, 2021 Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** 39% completion in the Foundations course of The Odin Project! I started learning about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I even got a very simplistic webpage together using what I learned!

**Thoughts:** It's really fun to learn, but surprisingly harder than when I was learning Python. I guess it's because the syntax in HTML and CSS is not very intuitive as it pertains to creating the layout of a webpage/website, whereas Python was used to solve logical problems. It certainly is not impossible by any means, but the learning curve might be a bit more noticeable. No worries! I can do it!!

### Day 3: June 24, 2021 Thursday

**Today's Progress:** I wanted a better understanding of HTML, so today I focused on learning HTML! There is a Responsive Web Design Certification by FreeCodeCamp that I wanted to try out, and this was the perfect opportunity to do so! I completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 course. Still at 39% completion in the Foundations course!

**Thoughts:** I want to start a project tomorrow only using HTML. I'm thinking maybe a survey form or a biography page??

### Day 4: June 25, 2021 Friday

**Today's Progress:** I began my learning of JavaScript through freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification! With some Python background, it's been a relatively smooth transition. I'm having so much fun! I also started freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries Certification to begin my learning of React! I also started Twitch's Training plan (through Onramp).

**Thoughts:** My goal right now is to go for Twitch's Fullstack + Frontend Apprenticeship program! I did a lot of jumping around today, but that was to get an idea of how to better structure my study sessions to best prepare myself to apply for the apprenticeship! The topics they focus on in their Training plan are React, TypeScript, GraphQL, Go, and AWS, so I felt that it was in my best interest to go through freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification first and then their Front End Development Libraries Certification. I'll get real familiar with JavaScript and React, and then prepare for the other topics through the Training plan. If necessary, I'll branch out and do my own studying if I need to gain a better understanding of the other topics.

### Day 5: June 26, 2021 Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Still going through the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification on freeCodeCamp! I planned on finishing the Basic Java course today, but a friend wanted to play some impromptu tennis! It was definitely a good break away from studying. I'll finish tomorrow (technically today though because I forgot to update the log yesterday!) and then get started on the ES6 course.

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot of interesting things about JavaScript that aren't prevalent in Python! They have strict equality operators and 8 different data types. One data type is called object, and that's basically Python dictionaries! It's interesting because it appears that JavaScript is associating this data type with object-oriented programming through the name they gave it, whereas Python simply referred to this data structure as a dictionary and it was not really inherently tied to OOP itself. You also first initialize objects in JS as variables! Very interesting.

### Day 6: June 27, 2021 Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Still working on the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification! Sometimes, life will throw you some curveballs that'll change your expectations and plans. That's okay! A little behind today, but I will make up for it tomorrow!

**Thoughts:** Learning objects in JavaScript is kind of challenging!

**Link(s) to work:** None.


### Day 7: June 28, 2021 Monday

**Today's Progress:** Almost done with the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification! This is kind of unrelated to coding, but I worked on my resume to prepare to apply for the Twitch apprenticeship!

**Thoughts:** I received an email from onramp telling me that the correct training plan is now live! My previous attack plan is no longer relevant, so I had to come up with a new strategy! Thankfully, the current training plan is shorter, but still requires my 110% effort! I am going to shift back to the Responsive Web Design Certification, complete that, put up some projects, and then finish up the rest of the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification! As I am doing this, I will also be working on my resume and my essays. I got this!

### Day 8: June 29, 2021 Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** I created a tribute page using mainly HTML today! It was more of a biography though; I wanted to use this opportunity to learn more about U.S. history, so I decided to research a random president! It ended up being Ronald Reagan. It was a great day of learning: learning of applying HTML to real life and learning of history!

**Thoughts:** Actually getting my hands dirty and struggling through today's project was a lot more helpful than passively engaging by watching YouTube video tutorials and reading HTML/CSS/JavaScript lessons on freeCodeCamp. I'll be tackling another project tomorrow-- a survey!

### Day 9: June 30, 2021 Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** I completed a survey project using HTML and CSS! I created a sunscreen awareness survey because I am super passionate about sunscreen use! It's extremely important to our skin health! This project was a win-win for me.

**Thoughts:** I'm in that phase where I have a general idea of how to code to reach my desired output, but it still takes quite a bit of googling. I'm getting real good at googling specific situations, that's for sure!

### Day 10: July 1, 2021 Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Unfortunately, I hit whatever the equivalent of writer's block is for programmers. Coding was extra hard today! I did play tennis though and that was fun!

**Thoughts:** Today was a rest day. I shall resume tomorrow!

### Day 11: July 2, 2021 Friday

**Today's Progress:** Since my focus these days is Twitch's apprenticeship, I beefed up my LinkedIn profile and my resume today! I also edited my preexisting projects on CodePen. 

**Thoughts:** Writing good resumes is hard *__*

### Day 12: July 3, 2021 Saturday

**Today's Progress:** I started my product landing page project today! It's going to be centered around sunscreen products. I have a general vision of how it'll turn out, so it's just a matter of coding it! I also continued to work on my resume, LinkedIn, and essay questions.

**Thoughts:** I've heard good things about the Head First series, so I think I'll give it a try!

**Link(s) to work:** None.


### Day 13: July 4, 2021 Sunday

**Today's Progress:** I actually found a better idea I want to pursue instead of the product landing page! I want to create a webpage that will let me rank all the sunscreen products I use. That's the general premise, but I want to add other features like comments, a proper ranking system, etc. It will be fun! So I began brainstorming for that idea on HTML/CSS. The Twitch application is due tomorrow as well! It was well out of my comfort zone, but I am so glad for the opportunity!

**Thoughts:** Happy happy 4th of July!
